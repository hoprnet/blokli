This only makes sense to support for HOPR safes, HOPR node EOA accounts and the channels contract.\nEven then the amount of chain logs which would have to be stored is a lot. Thus blokli uses the following approach. \nDuring initial sync transfer logs (ERC20) and transfer transactions (native) are completely ignored. Once synched the indexer also subscribes to these events. \nInternally blokli keeps an in-memory set of addresses which combines all known HOPR safe addresses, EOA addresses and the channels contract address. \nOnce an ERC20 transfer event is being handled, it will check against this set of addresses. \nIf the address is known, the balance will be fetched from chain via the RPC (sync operation) and the result stored in the in-memory data structure. If a balance is fetched via the GraphQL API it will try to read the balance from the data structure. If the key is not present, an error will be returned. If the key (address) is present and no balance is known yet, it will be fetched directly from the RPC (sync operation), stored in the data structure and returned to the API caller. If the balance is known, it will be returned directly.\nA similar approach is taken for native transfers. For these the indexer\nsubscribes to new blocks and checks all transactions in a new block for known\naddresses. If a known address is found, the native balance is fetched from chain\nvia the RPC (sync operation) and the result stored in the in-memory data\nstructure.
